# Multiallelic

Simulates deterministic evolution of multiallelic genotypes.

Please refer to the contents of the file 'input.txt' for guidance as to
how to set parameters.  './doit' alone reads from 'input.txt'.  You can
read from a custom file using './doit < input2.txt'.

To install, just run 'make'.
